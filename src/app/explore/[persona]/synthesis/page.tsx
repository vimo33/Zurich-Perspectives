            &ldquo;Zurich Perspectives: Economy, Equity, and Influence&rdquo; is
            an interactive web pilot exploring how residents with different
            incomes experience taxation, benefit from public spending, and
            navigate the political system in Zurich, Switzerland.

          <p className="mb-4">
            This project aims to illustrate how economic inequality translates
            into political inequality through multiple reinforcing mechanisms,
            creating a cycle that affects democratic participation and
            representation.
